# ALX Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary Projects
Welcome to the ALX Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary Projects repository! This repository contains projects related to working with sets and dictionaries in Python, which are important data structures for handling and manipulating data efficiently.
# Set Operations
In this project, you will explore various operations that can be performed on sets in Python. Sets are unordered collections of unique elements and offer useful methods for set operations such as union, intersection, difference, and more. You will learn how to use these operations effectively to manipulate and analyze data.

# Dictionary Manipulation
The second project focuses on working with dictionaries in Python. Dictionaries are key-value pairs that allow efficient lookup and retrieval of values based on unique keys. You will learn how to create dictionaries, access values, add or remove key-value pairs, iterate over dictionaries, and understand when to use dictionaries over other data structures.
