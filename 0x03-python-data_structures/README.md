# Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples Projects
This repository contains a collection of Python projects focused on working with data structures such as lists and tuples. These projects aim to demonstrate various operations, manipulations, and algorithms related to these data structures.

# Project List
1. List Operations

* Description: This project focuses on performing different operations on lists, such as adding elements, removing elements, accessing elements, and modifying elements. It provides examples and functions to showcase these operations and their usage.

2. Tuple Manipulation

* Description: This project explores tuple manipulation techniques, including tuple creation, accessing elements, slicing, and concatenation. It provides practical examples and functions to illustrate these concepts.

3. List Sorting

* Description: This project delves into sorting lists using various algorithms. It demonstrates different sorting techniques such as bubble sort, insertion sort, and selection sort, along with their implementations in Python.

4. Tuple Unpacking

* Description: This project focuses on the concept of tuple unpacking, which allows assigning multiple values from a tuple to multiple variables in a single statement. It provides examples and scenarios where tuple unpacking can be useful.
