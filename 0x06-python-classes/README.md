# Python Classes and Objects
- This repository contains examples and explanations of classes and objects in Python. It serves as a beginner-friendly guide to understanding the concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) using Python.


* Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that organizes code into reusable structures called classes. Classes define the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) of objects. Objects, on the other hand, are instances of classes, representing specific occurrences or entities in a program.

* This repository provides a step-by-step introduction to Python classes and objects, explaining key concepts such as attributes, methods, encapsulation, and more. The examples are designed to be easy to understand, even for those new to programming.
